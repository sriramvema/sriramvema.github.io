      <h2>Code Standard Agent</h2>
      <p>
        I built a custom fine-tuned DeepSeek Coder model that accepts raw Python code as input, evaluates its cleanliness, and generates an improved, standards-compliant version. 
        To support this, I constructed a 2,600-example “messy-to-clean” Python code dataset using Claude Haiku to synthetically generate paired samples. Each pair has been validated 
        to ensure the messy and clean versions are functionally identical. I fine-tuned the model using PyTorch to enable it to recognize common anti-patterns, detect structural 
        and stylistic issues, and produce clean, well-organized output aligned with Pythonic best practices. <br><br>

      <h2>StudyAI</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a React web application that uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to pull information from uploaded PDFs. 
        I used the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Huggingface to perform the RAG procedures. 
        This application's primary use is for students to receive study help in their classes, which is specifically tailored to the material given to them. 
        Once they upload a PDF of their class notes or textbook, each page is loaded into the RAG function and outputs the relevant pages for whatever the student's question is. 
        These pages are given to a Claude model as context to answer the user's question. For this project, I used the claude-3-haiku-20240307 model. 
        I have provided a link in my repository's Readme.md to a small demo I have prepared to show what the application looks like during use. <br><br>

      <h2>StockAI</h2>
      <p>
        This app is a useful tool for people who are beginning to get into the stock market. Beginners might be a little lost when it comes to finding information that could affect stock prices. 
        I used a webcrawler program that allows the user to search for the top 10 most relevant news articles for any stock on the Nasdaq. 
        My React app displays these articles along with an AI-generated summary for each article as well as a comprehensive summary for all of the articles together. 
        For this, I used Claude, and the model also generates an opinion on how this news could affect the price of the stock. 
        This is very useful for beginners because it will allow them to make informed decisions on whether they should buy or sell their stock. <br><br>
